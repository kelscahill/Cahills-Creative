Description: Allows you to distribute images inside ACF fields while using the Distributor plugin.

== Description ==

While using [Distributor](https://distributorplugin.com/) along with [Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/), images included inside fields (and/or nested inside them) are not distributed. This plugin fixes their correct handling,
even for images nested inside a number of fields.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `distribute-acf-images` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
